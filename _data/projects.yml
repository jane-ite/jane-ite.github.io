      SmartShoe is a project created by UCLA's <a href="http://er.cs.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">eHealth Research Lab</a> to help stop the habit of toe-walking (walking with one's weight on the ball of the foot) in children by housing a real-time feedback system in a sole, which communicates with a phone app. Uses easily obtainable electronic components.

      Originally designed to fit into a commercial shoe sole originally meant for hiding keys with the ability to be cut down to size. Case printed out of PETG.
    </p>

      Now converted to a fully 3D printed housing, sole as well as casing. The sole is printed out of TPU and case out of PLA. Boasts of a smaller profile and higher reliability.
